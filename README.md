# My-Woodworking-Site
Website on my woodworking projects. This is mostly a website that displays images of my work and demonstrates the implementation of front-end framework along with my own code for website development.

* Uses Bootstrap for some elements (nav, cards, dropdown) along with vanilla JS to display images (carousel and image array).
